Advanced Student Performance Management System
System Documentation
________________________________________
1. Project Overview
The Advanced Student Performance Management System is a Java-based application designed to help universities efficiently manage and monitor student academic performance.
The system tracks students, courses, grades, GPA calculations, and attendance records. Additionally, it provides automated alerts for students with low attendance, supporting early academic intervention.
By automating academic processes, the system reduces manual workload, improves data accuracy, and ensures secure access to performance information for both students and faculty members.

2. Project Objectives
The main objectives of this system are as follows:
•	Automate GPA calculation and academic performance tracking
•	Maintain accurate attendance records and generate alerts for low attendance
•	Provide role-based access control for students and faculty
•	Integrate a secure database system for storing academic data
•	Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for clean, maintainable, and scalable code
________________________________________
3. Technologies Used
The system is implemented using the following technologies:
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Database Management System: Microsoft SQL Server
•	Database Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
•	Design Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
•	Architecture Pattern: DAO (Data Access Object)

4. System Users and Roles
The system supports multiple user roles, each with specific permissions.
4.1 Students
Students can:
•	View their personal academic information
•	Calculate and view GPA
•	Check attendance percentage
•	Receive alerts when attendance falls below 75%
4.2 Faculty
Faculty members can:
•	Enter and update student grades
•	Define assessments and deadlines
•	View detailed student performance reports
4.3 Admin (Conceptual Role)
The admin role is responsible for:
•	Managing users, courses, and enrollments
•	Controlling and maintaining system data

5. Object-Oriented Design
The system follows Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
Key OOP Principles Applied
•	Inheritance: Student and Faculty classes inherit from the abstract User class
•	Abstraction: Implemented using the abstract User class and the PerformanceTracker interface
•	Encapsulation: Class attributes are private and accessed through getters and setters
•	Polymorphism: Methods such as login(), displayInfo(), and logout() are overridden in subclasses
Main System Classes
•	User (Abstract Class): Contains shared attributes such as username, password, and role
•	Student: Handles GPA calculation, attendance management, and student-specific data
•	Faculty: Manages grades, assessments, and student performance
•	Course: Stores course information and enrolled students
•	Enrollment: Links students with courses and records grades and semesters
•	AlertManager: Generates attendance alerts and performance notifications
•	DAO Classes: StudentDAO, AttendanceDAO, and EnrollmentDAO handle database operations
•	DBConnection: Manages JDBC connection with SQL Server

6. Database Design
The system uses SQL Server to store academic and user data securely.
Database Tables
Users
•	UserID (Primary Key)
•	Username
•	Password
•	Role (Student / Faculty)
Students
•	StudentID (Primary Key, Foreign Key to Users)
•	Name
•	Major
•	GPA
•	TotalHours
Faculty
•	FacultyID (Primary Key, Foreign Key to Users)
•	Name
•	Department
Courses
•	CourseID (Primary Key)
•	CourseCode
•	CourseName
•	CreditHours
Enrollments
•	EnrollmentID (Primary Key)
•	StudentID (Foreign Key)
•	CourseID (Foreign Key)
•	Semester
•	GradeType
•	Score
•	Year
Attendance
•	AttendanceID (Primary Key)
•	StudentID (Foreign Key)
•	TotalDays
•	AttendedDays
Entity Relationships
•	Users → Students / Faculty (1:1)
•	Students → Enrollments (1:N)
•	Courses → Enrollments (1:N)
•	Students → Attendance (1:1)

7. JDBC and DAO Integration
The system connects Java with SQL Server using JDBC.
The DBConnection class establishes and manages the database connection.
DAO classes are responsible for:
•	Validating user login credentials
•	Retrieving student and course data using SQL queries
•	Fetching grades and calculating GPA
•	Calculating attendance percentages and generating alerts
This approach ensures separation of concerns, improves maintainability, and enhances system scalability.
________________________________________
8. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The application provides a simple and user-friendly GUI, which includes:
•	Secure login screen
•	Student dashboard displaying GPA, courses, and attendance
•	Functional buttons to:
o	Calculate GPA
o	View attendance
o	View alerts
o	Display personal information
A conceptual faculty interface is also included for managing grades and assessments.
Screenshots of the GUI can be added to the final presentation or report.
